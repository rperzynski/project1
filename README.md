Project 1

This is my first full attempt at non-WYSIWYG-edited web page, and I am pleased with the results. I was able to learn (and remember) a lot of the basics about html, as well as discover a lot of new stuff. I had never used .css files before, and now that I understand how they work, I can really understand their value. I went through a lot of trial and error in order to get the page to look at least somewhat like I wanted, which could be frustrating. All of that error ending up making my .css a little more unwieldy than I would like, but I am still able to figure out why I did certain things.

I would like to gain the confidence needed in order to start a page WITHOUT so much trial and error - and at least be able to make a basic page from memory - without needing any other resources. I think that I am already on my way towards this goal. I think that going forward, I will have a better idea of where I should start, especially with respect to formatting and CSS.
